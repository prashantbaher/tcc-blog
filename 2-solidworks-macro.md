`Visual Basic for Application` or `VBA` macros is easiest way to start with programming in *Solidworks*. 

To use `Visual Basic for Application`, you must know working knowledge of *Solidworks* & hands on experience on *VB programming language*.

With the help of `Visual Basic for Application` we can perform any simple action to any complex action. 
But there are certain limitations to `Visual Basic for Application`. 

For example I found that for large project `Add-ins` are created using `VB.net` or `C#` *programming language*. 

It is not that with `Visual Basic for Application` you cannot do such kind of work. You can do almost any type of work you want in *Solidworks* but I found that other languages are more useful in creating very large and complex projects. 

They are especially useful in organizing the project. For example, in `VB.net & C#`, we can create `Folders` for project arrangement.

But it not necessary that we should ignore `Visual Basic for Application` and jump to these advance languages. 

Remember every complex project starts with few `simple procedures`. 

Likewise after completing some simple macros you can combine more than one macro to form a single macro and make it more complex over the period of time.

If you are a *total begineer* and want to learn how to create `VBA macros` in *Solidworks* than follow these tutorials in order they are given.

If you have done `VBA programming` in *Solidworks* before and you are somethings specific then go to that topic.
