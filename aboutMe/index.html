          <p>Hello,</p>

<p>You come here it means you want to know about this blog more and the person who is sharing this knowledge.</p>

<p>For organization purpose I have divided this page into the parts.</p>

<p>Feel free to jump to the topic you want to read.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>I am a <strong>CAD engineer</strong> and using <strong>Solidworks 3D CAD Software</strong> from <strong><em>past 8 years</em></strong>.</p>

<p>I begin learning to programme from 2017.</p>

<p>Since then I learn different programming languages. Most of them are Microsoft technologies.</p>

<p>It is because in our job we use most of the <strong>Microsoft</strong> products like:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>MS Outlook</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>MS Excel</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>MS Powerpoint</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Now I have knowledge of following programming languages:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Visual Basic for Application, also known as VBA</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>C#</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>C++</strong></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>I am very comfortable in <strong>VBA</strong> and <strong>C#</strong> but I am still learning <strong>C++</strong> programming language.</p>

<p>I also have some knowledge of <em>Excel macros</em> but I am <strong>not</strong> very good at it.</p>

<p>I am good at <strong>Solidworks API</strong> and its application in the following languages:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><em>VBA</em> for <em>creating macros</em> in Solidworks</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>C#</em> for <em>Add-in</em> or <em>Standalone application</em> in Solidworks</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Visual C++</em> just for <strong>fun</strong> in Solidworks</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="why-did-i-learn-to-programme">Why did I learn to programme?</h2>

<p>In <strong>2017</strong>, we are using <strong>Solidworks 2015</strong> and <strong>Microsoft Excel</strong> documents for our project.</p>

<p>At that time, my <strong>CAD manager</strong> was working on <em>automation</em> of different project in <strong>Autodesk Inventor CAD</strong> Software using <strong><em>i-Logic</em></strong>.</p>

<p><em>By seeing him and doing this automation, I also want to do the same thing in my project also!</em></p>

<p>I talk with my team and ask them for the suggestions but they are not much interested.</p>

<p>Then I watch some <strong>YouTube Videos</strong> and get my hands dirty with macros.</p>

<p>After some time I got the <strong>confidence</strong> and now I am able to write <strong>macros</strong> with accurate use <em>Google</em>.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="how-did-i-learn-to-programme">How did I learn to programme?</h2>

<p>I know that I had to learn <strong>VBA macro programming</strong> for automation of tasks.</p>

<p>I ask for some <em>guidance</em> from my <em>Software developer</em> friends who are working on <em>CAD Software development</em> in my company.</p>

<p>They told me to learn about <em>programming basics</em>, <em>Logical thinking</em> and <em>VBA programming language</em>.</p>

<p>For learning purpose they told me to learn from <strong>YouTube Videos</strong>.</p>

<p>Then I look for some online tutorials like <strong>YouTube Videos</strong> and <strong>free online course</strong>.</p>

<p>On YouTube, I got a playlist from <strong><a href="https://youtu.be/Pp0Kc89g7mE">Me in 3d</a></strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Select the link, if you want to watch those tutorials.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I watch all the videos and then complete all the macros as given in these videos.</p>

<p>This gives me <em>confidence</em> but <strong>not</strong> the knowledge I was looking for.</p>

<p><em>Hence I look for more resources and did not find a useful resource which can teach me macro programming step by step.</em></p>

<p>At that time, my developer friends suggest me to learn about <strong>VBA macro programming</strong> in <strong>Microsoft Excel</strong>.</p>

<p>They told me that, both <strong>Solidworks</strong> and <strong>Microsoft Excel</strong> use macros written in <em>VBA programming language</em> and in the later stage of development I have to learn both to integrate for large complex project.</p>

<p>So I started searching for macro tutorials for <strong>Microsoft Excel</strong>.</p>

<p>In office, it is very difficult for me to watch all the videos and do works at the same time.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At home, I want to spend my more time with wife who was not well at that point of time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I thought I should look for <strong>a Book</strong> for this and luckily I found <strong>a book</strong> on Amazon which is shown below.</p>

    <script src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US"></script>
</div>

<p>This is updated copy of the same book.</p>

<p>If you want to buy this book you can but it from Amazon by clicking above image ad.</p>

<p><em>Reading a book</em> and <em>working</em> in an office at the same time is an easy task for me.</p>

<p>I started working with the book and get confidence in programming.</p>

<p>From this book, I learnt <strong>programming concepts</strong> and <strong>VBA programming language</strong> because I was not keen on learning <strong>Microsoft Excel macro programming</strong> hence I did not learn it.</p>

<p>After learning <strong>programming concepts</strong> and <strong>VBA programming language</strong>, I started creating <strong>Solidworks macros in VBA</strong> programming language.</p>

<p>At first, I <strong>record</strong> macros and <strong>try to understand every line code</strong> for example meaning of a line, why we use it here &amp; so on.</p>

<p><strong>Soon I know that recorded macros are not much help because it adds lots of Garbage code in it.</strong></p>

<p>At this stage, I combine the knowledge I learn from video tutorial of <strong>Men in 3D</strong> and knowledge I get from reading the book.</p>

<p>By doing this,at slow pace, I was getting good at <strong>VBA macro programming</strong> in <strong>Solidworks</strong> without much help from others.</p>

<p>There are some times where I need to ask for help, at that time my developer friends helped me much.</p>

<p>I learn all this much by <strong>May 2018</strong> and I was very <strong><em>persistent</em></strong> with that. 
Then I started creating macros for my project.</p>

<p>I started by <strong>identifying the smallest tasks</strong> to automate and <strong>then create Solidworks VBA macro</strong> for a particular task.</p>

<p>I identified some 10-15 tasks and create Solidworks VBA macros for those tasks.</p>

<p>In the Meantime, I also create a macro for one of my friend who saw me and asks my help.</p>

<p>After creating some <strong>Solidworks VBA macros</strong> I show them to my <em>software developer</em> friend in the company and he told me to create an <strong>Add-in</strong> in Solidworks 3D CAD Software by combining the functionality of all the macros I have created.</p>

<p>I was on learning spree hence took this task and started my journey of learning how to create add-in in Solidworks 3D CAD software.</p>

<p>Here I come across <strong>YouTube</strong> tutorials from <strong><a href="http://www.angelsix.com/youtube">AngelSix</a></strong>, <strong>SolidDNA tutorials</strong> and his books for <strong>Solidworks API programming</strong>.</p>

<p>These tutorials really helped me a lot.</p>

<p>From <strong><a href="http://www.angelsix.com/youtube">AngelSix</a></strong> YouTube Channel, I learnt basic <strong>C# programming languages</strong> as well and found it <strong>very helpful, practical and professional</strong>.</p>

<p>Learning <strong>C# programming language</strong> from his channel greatly boost my confidence.</p>

<p>After <strong>2 months</strong> of learning from his <strong><a href="http://www.angelsix.com/youtube">YouTube Channel</a></strong>, I started creating <strong>Add-in</strong> in <strong>Solidworks</strong> with <strong>C# programming language</strong> along with <strong>Window Presentation Foundation (WPF)</strong> for modern User Interface.</p>

<p>It took me more <strong>6 months</strong> to create an <strong>Solidworks C# add-in</strong> which has all the same functionality of previously done macros.</p>

<p><strong>My software developer friends, my CAD manager and everybody in my team was blown away when I showed them the add-in I had created.</strong></p>

<p><em>My work was recognised by everyone in my department which makes me very happy!!!</em></p>

<p>I stopped creating more macros myself because my teams mates are doing this job for themselves.</p>

<p>I help them in creating <strong>Solidworks VBA macros</strong> and <strong>Solidworks Standalone Application</strong> for themselves.</p>

<p>After that, I started learning <strong>C++ programming language</strong> by reading books from the creator of C++ programming language <strong><em>Bjarne Stroustrup</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Those books are shown below.</p>

<p>1st is very good for learning programming itself!!!</p>

<p>A <strong>must recommendation</strong> to all those who want to learn <strong>how to think for programming</strong> !!</p>

<p>2nd book is an advance book, mainly use for <strong><em>reference</em></strong> in <strong>C++ programming language</strong>.</p>

<p>If you want to buy these books you can but them from Amazon by clicking above image ads.</p>

<p>After reading the 1st book I thought I should start implementing my new knowledge in creating some application.</p>

<p>I choose <strong>C++ programming language</strong> and <strong>Solidworks C++ API</strong> for recreating what I had done previously.</p>

<p>It took me more <em>6-8 months</em> for learning <strong>C++ programming language</strong> and <strong>Solidworks C++ API</strong> but I create only <strong>10%</strong> of the tasks.</p>

<p>It was simply because after everyone noticed the my programming skills, I asked my developer friends to assign me some work.</p>

<p>So that I can learn what <strong>actual software development process</strong> looks like and how they do it.</p>

<p>Because of this, I am not able to give much time to <strong>C++ programming language</strong> and <strong>Solidworks C++ API</strong>.</p>

<p>But I am sure if anybody wants to start a <strong>C++ project</strong> for Solidworks I can really help in this.</p>

<p>Basically I read a lot, work a lot and practice a lot. Because of these I learn all these things.</p>

<h2 id="purpose-of-this-blog">Purpose of this blog</h2>

<p>Purpose of this blog is simple.</p>

<div class="w3-border w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-border-green w3-pale-green">
Share my knowledge of Solidworks VBA Macro development and provide Solidworks C# API help in a tutorial format.
</div>
<p>Since I was sharing my knowledge with <em>my co-workers</em>, I thought why don’t share this knowledge with other people who wants to learn these skills.</p>

<p>Also, I believe that everybody should have access to the knowledge they are looking for and this blog gives me the opportunity to share my knowledge around the world.</p>

<p><em>And blogging is a good way to do this!!!</em></p>

<p>In this blog, I write tutorial posts about VBA programming language and Solidworks VBA macro development.</p>

<p>I want to write these tutorials in a <strong>beginner-friendly manner</strong> so that those who <strong>do not</strong> have <strong>programming knowledge</strong> will not get <strong>intimated</strong> by this.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>It is an easy task but it takes time to learn and master.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also, in recent time when I search for the job openings, I found that there is an increase in demand for this type of skill also.</p>

<p>Which really surprise me!!</p>

<p>This encouraged me to write more on this blog. So that more people can get help from my blog.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="future-plans">Future Plans</h2>

<p>I want to go step by step in this blog.</p>

<p>First I covered some basic on <strong>VBA programming language</strong> with examples but they are <strong>basic</strong>.</p>

<p>Currently, I am writing posts on individual <strong>Solidworks functions</strong> in Sketch Module.</p>

<p>I would like to proceed by covering the following modules one-by-one:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Solidworks Sketch Module</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Solidworks Part Module</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Solidworks Assembly Module</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Solidworks Drawing Module</strong></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>It will take time to create cover these modules.</p>

<p>I also want to explain these topics with VBA examples also.</p>

<p>As you can understand it is a huge task to cover all these with VBA examples so it takes time but slowly we will cover all these.</p>

<p>If you want to want to know the full list of my recommended books I have listed them in my Resouces page. Please check it also.</p>

<p><strong>If you like my work please share with other people also.</strong></p>

<p>I like the motto of <strong><em>Sharing is caring</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Hence if you find my blog helpful then I request you to share with your friends, colleagues and other people who want to learn these sort of things.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy learning from these tutorials and create macros from your own.</p>

I am a **CAD engineer** and working on **Solidworks** 3D Software.

In 2017, I want to *automate* my current project. So I was looking for resources for creating `VBA` macros.

I started with *recording macros* but soon I realized its limitation. Then I started looking for tutorials on creating macros from scratch.

I found some tutorials on websites but they are not much helpful.

After browsing these websites and tutorials I found that I need to learn 2 things for creating macros from scratch.

1. Visual Basic for Application (VBA) programming language

2. Solidworks API help document

Now as a `mechanical engineer`, learning a programming language feels very intimidating.

In starting I did not understand what a `loop` is and why we use it for!!!

But *slowly-slowly*, I am getting it and started creating some basic macros from my own.

Honestly, for learning `VBA programming language` I take help from books on VBA macros books on `MS Excel`. 

It is because `VBA` is used in *Excel Automation* mostly, that's what in internet show!!!

After learning *some fundamentals*, I started looking on resource for Solidworks macro creation.

I found a book by Luke Malpass on Solidworks Add-in.

> You can download these books free from [AngelSix](http://www.angelsix.com/download/solidworks-files)

These books were a very big help to me in learning some basic to intermediate concepts of Solidworks.

I also watch [Me in 3d](https://youtu.be/Pp0Kc89g7mE) macro tutorials for learning basics of Solidworks API.

After all this **reading and watching** I started with creating macros for my projects. 

I must tell you it was not an easy task. After a large number of trials, I finally had a working macro.

It takes me around `6 months` to create a perfect working macro which my team use. After creating several macros, I get confidence in them.

After creating macros, I started for creating add-in also. This time in C# programming language.

Here, free `C#` and `SolidDna` tutorials from [AngelSix](http://www.angelsix.com/youtube) (again **Luke**) helps me completely. I watch his videos *2-3 times* and follow as shown in videos.

This helps me to learn `C#` and `add-in` programming.

I also watched `WPF tutorials` from his [YouTube](http://www.angelsix.com/youtube) channel and still following him there.

As you can see, it is a **very long journey** for me to learn macros and add-in for Solidworks.

Because of this, I thought why not share my knowledge and help those who want to learn Macro programming. 

Hence I started a blog about `VBA macro` tutorial learning.

Before this blog, I had a similar blog named [Solidworkmacrotutorials](https://solidworkmacrotutorial.blogspot.com/). 

I had to shift from [Solidworkmacrotutorials](https://solidworkmacrotutorial.blogspot.com/). It is difficult for me to write `code examples` and I don't have much control how the blog should look like.

I posted tutorials on `VBA programming` but I did not post more tutorials on `Solidworks API` there.

I gave my time in finding a suitable replacement for that blog and then I started this blog.

I hope you enjoy learning from these tutorials and create macros from your own.
