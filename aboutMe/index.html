so on.</p><p><strong>Soon I know that recorded macros are not much help because it adds lots of Garbage code in it.</strong></p><p>At this stage, I combine the knowledge I learn from video tutorial of <strong>Men in 3D</strong> and knowledge I get from reading the book.</p><p>By doing this,at slow pace, I was getting good at <strong>VBA macro programming</strong> in <strong>Solidworks</strong> without much help from others.</p><p>There are some times where I need to ask for help, at that time my developer friends helped me much.</p><p>I learn all this much by <strong>May 2018</strong> and I was very <strong><em>persistent</em></strong> with that.
Then I started creating macros for my project.</p><p>I started by <strong>identifying the smallest tasks</strong> to automate and <strong>then create Solidworks VBA macro</strong> for a particular task.</p><p>I identified some 10-15 tasks and create Solidworks VBA macros for those tasks.</p><p>In the Meantime, I also create a macro for one of my friend who saw me and asks my help.</p><p>After creating some <strong>Solidworks VBA macros</strong> I show them to my <em>software developer</em> friend in the company and he told me to create an <strong>Add-in</strong> in Solidworks 3D CAD Software by combining the functionality of all the macros I have created.</p><p>I was on learning spree hence took this task and started my journey of learning how to create add-in in Solidworks 3D CAD software.</p><p>Here I come across <strong>YouTube</strong> tutorials from <strong><a href="http://www.angelsix.com/youtube" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AngelSix</a></strong>, <strong>SolidDNA tutorials</strong> and his books for <strong>Solidworks API programming</strong>.</p><p>These tutorials really helped me a lot.</p><p>From <strong><a href="http://www.angelsix.com/youtube" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AngelSix</a></strong> YouTube Channel, I learnt basic <strong>C# programming languages</strong> as well and found it <strong>very helpful, practical and professional</strong>.</p><p>Learning <strong>C# programming language</strong> from his channel greatly boost my confidence.</p><p>After <strong>2 months</strong> of learning from his <strong><a href="http://www.angelsix.com/youtube" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube Channel</a></strong>, I started creating <strong>Add-in</strong> in <strong>Solidworks</strong> with <strong>C# programming language</strong> along with <strong>Window Presentation Foundation (WPF)</strong> for modern User Interface.</p><p>It took me more <strong>6 months</strong> to create an <strong>Solidworks C# add-in</strong> which has all the same functionality of previously done macros.</p><p><strong>My software developer friends, my CAD manager and everybody in my team was blown away when I showed them the add-in I had created.</strong></p><p><em>My work was recognised by everyone in my department which makes me very happy!!!</em></p><p>I stopped creating more macros myself because my teams mates are doing this job for themselves.</p><p>I help them in creating <strong>Solidworks VBA macros</strong> and <strong>Solidworks Standalone Application</strong> for themselves.</p><p>After that, I started learning <strong>C++ programming language</strong> by reading books from the creator of C++ programming language <strong><em>Bjarne Stroustrup</em></strong>.</p><p>Those books are shown below.</p><div class="w3-border w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-border-blue w3-pale-blue"><script>amzn_assoc_tracking_id = &quot;thecadcoder-20&quot;; amzn_assoc_ad_mode = &quot;manual&quot;; amzn_assoc_ad_type = &quot;smart&quot;; amzn_assoc_marketplace = &quot;amazon&quot;; amzn_assoc_region = &quot;US&quot;; amzn_assoc_design = &quot;enhanced_links&quot;; amzn_assoc_asins = &quot;0321992784&quot;; amzn_assoc_placement = &quot;adunit&quot;; amzn_assoc_linkid = &quot;6056d59d371f4e2ceeee911e72cae817&quot;;</script><script src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US"></script></div><p>1st is very good for learning programming itself!!!
