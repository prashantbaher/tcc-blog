I am a **CAD engineer** and working on **Solidworks** 3D Software.

In 2017, I want to *automate* my current project. So I was looking for resources for creating `VBA` macros.

I started with *recording macros* but soon I realized its limitation. Then I started looking for tutorials on creating macros from scratch.

I found some tutorials on websites but they are not much helpful.

After browsing these websites and tutorials I found that I need to learn 2 things for creating macros from scratch.

1. Visual Basic for Application (VBA) programming language

2. Solidworks API help document

Now as a `mechanical engineer`, learning a programming language feels very intimidating.

In starting I did not understand what a `loop` is and why we use it for!!!

But *slowly-slowly*, I am getting it and started creating some basic macros from my own.

Honestly, for learning `VBA programming language` I take help from books on VBA macros books on `MS Excel`. 

It is because `VBA` is used in *Excel Automation* mostly, that's what in internet show!!!

After learning *some fundamentals*, I started looking on resource for Solidworks macro creation.

I found a book by Luke Malpass on Solidworks Add-in.

> You can download these books free from [AngelSix](http://www.angelsix.com/download/solidworks-files)

These books were a very big help to me in learning some basic to intermediate concepts of Solidworks.

I also watch [Me in 3d](https://youtu.be/Pp0Kc89g7mE) macro tutorials for learning basics of Solidworks API.

After all this **reading and watching** I started with creating macros for my projects. 

I must tell you it was not an easy task. After a large number of trials, I finally had a working macro.

It takes me around `6 months` to create a perfect working macro which my team use. After creating several macros, I get confidence in them.

After creating macros, I started for creating add-in also. This time in C# programming language.

Here, free `C#` and `SolidDna` tutorials from [AngelSix](http://www.angelsix.com/youtube) (again **Luke**) helps me completely. I watch his videos *2-3 times* and follow as shown in videos.

This helps me to learn `C#` and `add-in` programming.

I also watched `WPF tutorials` from his [YouTube](http://www.angelsix.com/youtube) channel and still following him there.

As you can see, it is a **very long journey** for me to learn macros and add-in for Solidworks.

Because of this, I thought why not share my knowledge and help those who want to learn Macro programming. 

Hence I started a blog about `VBA macro` tutorial learning.

Before this blog, I had a similar blog named [Solidworkmacrotutorials](https://solidworkmacrotutorial.blogspot.com/). 

I had to shift from [Solidworkmacrotutorials](https://solidworkmacrotutorial.blogspot.com/). It is difficult for me to write `code examples` and I don't have much control how the blog should look like.

I posted tutorials on `VBA programming` but I did not post more tutorials on `Solidworks API` there.

I gave my time in finding a suitable replacement for that blog and then I started this blog.

I hope you enjoy learning from these tutorials and create macros from your own.
