Hello,

I will start posting *aricles* and *videos* on **Inventor C# API** tutorials along with **[Solidworks VBA tutorials](/solidworks-macros/vba-in-solidworks/)**.

I am not creating any **Add-in** in **Inventor** instead I will create **WPF Application** using **[PRISM](https://prismlibrary.com/index.html) + MVVM Pattern**.

This seems a lot, but it is a standard currently using in Software Industry.

For whom this section might be interested?

 * *Those who want to learn **Inventor C# API***

 * *Student doing Masters in CAD/CAM*

 * *Those who want to learn **WPF Application** with **Inventor** using **Prism Library**.*

 * *Programmers like myself who want to apply what is learnt!*

That's it!!!

Hope this post helps you.

*If you like the post then please share it with your friends also.*

*Do let me know by you like this post or not!*

*Till then, Happy learning!!!*
