I"W<p>To understand <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Visual Basic for Application</code>, lets look at the following <em>questions</em>.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-visual-basic-for-application">What is Visual Basic for Application?</h2>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Visual Basic for Applications</code> also known as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">VBA</code>, is a <em>programming language</em> developed by <strong>Microsoft</strong>.</p>

<p><em>SOLIDWORKS</em>, along with <em>Excel</em> and other software of <em>Office Suit</em>, includes <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">VBA</code> language (at no extra cost).</p>

<p>In a nutshell, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">VBA</code> is a tool that people use to develop program that control <em>SOLIDWORKS</em>.</p>

<p>Think about <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">a robot</code> that knows everything about <em>SOLIDWORKS</em>. This robot can <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">read instruction</code>, and it can also <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">operate</code> <em>SOLIDWORKS</em> very fast and accurate.</p>

<p>When you want the robot to do something in <em>SOLIDWORKS</em>, you write up a set of robotic instruction by using special codes.</p>

<p>Tell the robot to follow your instruction, while you sit back and take some rest. That’s kind of what <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">VBA</code> is all about.</p>

<h2 id="what-can-you-do-with-vba">What can you do with VBA?</h2>

<p>You know that people use different <em>CAD softwares</em>, not just <em>SOLIDWORKS</em>, for different tasks.</p>

<p>Below is a list of some common tasks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Creating sketches</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Creating 3D models</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Creating Simple to Complex assemblies of 3D models</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Linking files with external softwares mostly excel and many more tasks</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This list could go on and on, but you get the idea.</p>

<p>My point is simply that a CAD Software like <em>SOLIDWORKS</em> used for wide variety of things.</p>

<p>Everyone visiting this blog has different <em>needs and expectations</em>.</p>

<p>One thing virtually every visitor has common is the need to automate some aspect of their work. That is what VBA is all about.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-the-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-vba">What are the advantages and disadvantages of VBA?</h2>

<p>In this section, I briefly describe the good things about <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">VBA</code> – and I also explore its darker side.</p>

<h3 id="vba-advantages">VBA Advantages</h3>

<p>You can <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">automate</code> almost anything you do in <em>SOLIDWORKS</em>.</p>

<p>To do so, you write <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">instructions</code> that <em>SOLIDWORKS</em> carries out.</p>

<p>Automating a task by using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">VBA</code> offers several advantages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><em>SOLIDWORKS</em> always executes the tasks in exactly the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">same way</code>. (In most cases consistency is good.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>SOLIDWORKS</em> performs the task much <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">faster</code> than you do it manually.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you are a good macro programmer, <em>SOLIDWORKS</em> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">always</code> performs the task without <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">error</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you set things properly, someone who don’t know anything about <em>SOLIDWORKS</em> can perform task.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For long, time-consuming tasks, you don’t have to sit in front of your computer and get board. <em>SOLIDWORKS</em> does work, while you drink water.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="vba-disadvantages">VBA disadvantages</h3>

<p>It’s only fair that I give equal time to listing the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">disadvantages</code> (or potential disadvantages) of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">VBA</code>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>You have to know how to write programs in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">VBA</code> (but that’s why you are here, right?). Fortunately, it’s not as difficult as you might expect.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sometimes, things go wrong. In other words, you can’t blindly assume that your VBA program will always work correctly under all circumstances. Welcome to world of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">debugging</code> and, if others are using your macros, be prepared for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">technical support</code>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="vba-in-nutshell">VBA in nutshell</h2>

<p>Just to let you know what you are in for, I’ve prepared a quick summary of what <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">VBA</code> is all about.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>You perform actions in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">VBA</code> by writing (or recording) <em>code</em> in a <strong>VBA module</strong>. You view and edit <strong>VBA modules</strong> by using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Visual Basic Editor (VBE)</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <strong>VBA module</strong> consists of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sub procedures</code>. A <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sub procedure</code> is a chunk of computer code that performs some action on or with objects. The following example shows a simple <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sub procedure</code> called AddThem.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This amazing program displays the result of 1 plus 1.</p>

<div class="language-vb highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">Sub</span> <span class="nf">AddThem</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="n">Sum</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
    <span class="n">MsgBox</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"The answer is "</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="n">Sum</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">End</span> <span class="k">Sub</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next post will be about <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Visual Basic Editor</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">VBE</code>.</p>
