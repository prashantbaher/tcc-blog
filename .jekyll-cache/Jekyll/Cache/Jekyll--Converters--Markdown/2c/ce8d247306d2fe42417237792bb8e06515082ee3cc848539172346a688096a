I")<p>I can’t tell you how to completely eliminate bugs in your programs.</p>

<p>Finding bugs in software can be a profession by itself, but I can provide a few tips to help you keep those bugs to a minimum:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Use an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Option Explicit</code> statement at the beginning of your modules. This statement requires you to define the data type for every variable you use. This creates a bit more work for you, but you avoid the common error of misspelling a variable name. And it has a nice side benefit: <em>Your routines run a bit faster.</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Format your code with <strong>indentation</strong>. Using indentations helps delineate different code segments. If your program has several nested <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">For-Next</code> loops, for example, consistent indentation helps you keep track of them all.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use lots of <strong>comments</strong>. Nothing is more frustrating than revisiting code you wrote six months ago and not having a clue as to how it works. By adding a few comments to describe your logic, you can save lots of time down the road.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Keep your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sub</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Function</code> procedures simple. By writing your code in small modules, each of which has a single, well-defined purpose, you simplify the debugging process.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use the macro recorder to help identify properties and methods. When I can’t remember the name or the syntax of a property or method, I often simply record a macro and look at the recorded code</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Debugging code is not one of my favorite activities, but it’s a necessary evil that goes along with programming.</p>

<p>As you gain more experience with VBA, you spend less time debugging and, when you have to debug, are more efficient at doing so.</p>
