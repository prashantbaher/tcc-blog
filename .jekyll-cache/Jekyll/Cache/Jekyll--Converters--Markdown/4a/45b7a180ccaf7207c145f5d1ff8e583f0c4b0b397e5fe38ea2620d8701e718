<p>In this post, I tell you what you need to start with <em>Solidworks C++ API</em>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, Solidworks is required. Any version will do. But <em>Solidworks 2016</em> or more is preferable.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We need <em>Visual studio Community edition</em> and we will download it for <strong>free</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Knowledge of <em>C++ programming language.</em></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="visual-studio-community-edition">Visual Studio Community edition</h2>

<p>Since we want to learn <em>Solidworks C++ API</em>. We need Solidworks Software.</p>

<p><strong><em>So I assume that you have it otherwise you donâ€™t come to this website!</em></strong></p>

<p>Now we need <em>Visual Studio Community edition</em> and <em>Visual Studio 2019 Community edition</em> is the latest version.</p>

<p>If you are downloading <em>1st</em> time, then download <em>2019 version</em>.</p>

<p>I have <em>Visual Studo 2017 Community edition</em> installed hence I will use <em>2017 Community version</em> which is a <em>free version</em> for learning purpose.</p>

<p>One benefit of using <em>Visual Studio</em> is that it is a industry standard <strong>IDE</strong> hence if someone wants to do a job as <em>developer</em> s/he can use it and have the experience.</p>

<p>There are lots of videos out there which show you how to download Visual Studio Community edition.</p>

<p>One such video is shown below. Please go through that video which provide you all steps.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Please note that this video is <strong>2 years</strong> old but still relevent, <strong>URLs</strong> are same for downloading purpose.</p>

<p>Benefit of this video is that it is part of <em>C++ tutorial</em> in <em>Visual studio</em>.</p>

<h2 id="knowledge-of-c-programming-language">Knowledge of C++ programming language</h2>

<p>If you donâ€™t have Knowledge of <em>C++ programming language</em>, then you can use any course from <strong>YouTube</strong>.</p>

<p>I personally find below playlist more useful, so if you like you can learn from below playlist also.</p>

<p>Now we are ready to start our <em>1st Hello World</em> program in <em>Solidworks</em> using <strong>Solidworks C++ APIs</strong>.</p>

<p>Hope this post helps you to <em>setup softwares</em>.</p>
