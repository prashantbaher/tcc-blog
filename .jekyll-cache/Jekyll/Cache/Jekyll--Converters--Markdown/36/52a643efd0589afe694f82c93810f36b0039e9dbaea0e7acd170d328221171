<p>Nothing special I have to say or write for this <em>Solidworks C++ API</em> tutorials.</p>

<p>I will start posting on <em>Solidworks C++ API</em> tutorials along with <a href="/solidworks-macros/vba-in-solidworks/">Solidworks VBA tutorials</a> on <strong>casual basis</strong> (Whenever I got time).</p>

<p>For whom this section might be interested?</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><em>Those who want to learn Solidworks C++ API</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Student doing Masters in CAD/CAM</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Casual programmers like myself who want to apply what is learnt!</em></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>One thing is sure, I am not going to explain in very detail because I am more of a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.NET developer</code> not a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C++ Developer</code>.</p>

<p>I just want to explore <strong>C++ in Visual studio</strong> and best way to do is writing some program using my existing knowledge of <strong><em>Solidworks C# API</em></strong>.</p>

<p>So <strong><em>Solidworks C++ API</em></strong> posts are more ‚Äú<strong>how</strong>‚Äù to type not much descriptive like <a href="/solidworks-macros/vba-in-solidworks">Solidworks VBA posts</a>, which tends to describe in detailed manner.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs it!!!</p>

<p>I hope you will like this and enjoy this section also.</p>

<p>Thanks!!!</p>
