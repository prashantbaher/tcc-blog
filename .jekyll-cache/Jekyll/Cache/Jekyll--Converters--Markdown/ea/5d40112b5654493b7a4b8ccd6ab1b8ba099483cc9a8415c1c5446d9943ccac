<h2 id="visual-basic-for-application-vba-programming-language">Visual Basic for Application (VBA) programming language</h2>

<p>To learn <strong>Visual Basic for Application or VBA</strong> programming language, I used <strong>Excel Macros for Dummies book</strong>.</p>

<p>This book helps me in understanding programming concepts and learning VBA programming language syntaxes.</p>

<p>This book is beginner friendly and teaches in an easy manner!!</p>

<p>If you can want buy this book from Amazon, you can buy it by clicking below image ad.</p>

<p>If you don’t want to spend money to buy this book then it is ok!!</p>

<p>Not everyone learns by reading a book.</p>

<p>You can read <a href="/vba/vba-Introduction/">VBA tutorials</a> from this blog.</p>

<h2 id="solidworks-vba-macros">Solidworks VBA Macros</h2>

<p>I learn <strong>Solidworks VBA macro</strong> from <strong><a href="https://youtu.be/Pp0Kc89g7mE">Me in 3d</a></strong> YouTube channel.</p>

<p>You can watch those videos by clicking above text link.</p>

<p>I am also giving tutorials on <strong><a href="/solidworks-macros/vba-in-solidworks/">Solidworks VBA macros</a></strong> in this blog.</p>

<p>You can go to <strong><a href="/solidworks-macros/vba-in-solidworks/">Solidworks VBA macros</a></strong> page of this blog and look for the articles I wrote till now.</p>

<p><em>This is why this blog exists!!!</em></p>

<p>If you like to read and want to make fast progress I suggest you buy the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1630570842/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thecadcoder-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=1630570842&amp;linkId=8c189800c13ab510a8c3fe83beda26df">Automating SOLIDWORKS 2017 Using Macros</a> book.</p>

<p>You can buy this book from Amazon by selecting <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1630570842/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thecadcoder-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=1630570842&amp;linkId=8c189800c13ab510a8c3fe83beda26df">this link</a>.</p>

<p>Although I had not read this book it is updated one out there.</p>

<p>If you want to download Free books of <strong>AngelSix</strong>, you can download those by <a href="http://www.angelsix.com/download/solidworks-files">clicking here</a>.</p>

<p>It will start downloading those books at your machine.</p>

<h2 id="c-programming-language">C# programming language</h2>

<p>I learn <strong>C# programming language</strong> by watching <strong>C# tutorials</strong> of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ3AxeCHGPZkMi3kRfCuiHw">AngelSix YouTube</a> Videos.</p>

<p>You can also watch those tutorials by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrW43fNmjaQXhWOKalftye87ObZA-xNIJ">clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><em>These tutorials are easy to understand and content is presented in a very professional manner.</em></p>

<p>In-fact <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ3AxeCHGPZkMi3kRfCuiHw">AngelSix YouTube</a> channel is the best YouTube channel out there for learning actual programming in <strong>C# programming language</strong>.</p>

<p>I personally like this channel because the person behind <strong>LUKE</strong> was a <strong>CAD Engineer</strong> and had done automation <strong>Solidworks</strong> and <strong>Autodesk Inventor</strong>.</p>

<p>If you want to know more about him you can read <a href="https://www.angelsix.com/about">about him here</a>.</p>

<p>He also write free books on Solidworks API but I think they are now outdated.</p>

<p>But still if you want to read them you can download them.</p>

<p>Apart from that I also use “C# 7.0 in a Nutshell: The Definitive Reference” as a reference and glance over it regularly.</p>

<p>Image of this book is shown below</p>

<p>If you want to buy this book you can buy it from Amazon by clicking above image.</p>

<p>Other than these you will need help from others so you need a good habit of asking questions online.</p>

<p>You can ask me questions also but I am not an expert in this.</p>

<p><strong>Luke</strong> is the right person for clearing your doubt in the <strong>C# programming language</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="solidworks-c-add-in">Solidworks C# Add-in</h2>

<p>I learn <strong>Solidworks C# Add-in</strong> by watching again <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ3AxeCHGPZkMi3kRfCuiHw">AngelSix</a> videos (again him!!) of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrW43fNmjaQVMN1-lsB29ECnHRlA4ebYn">SolidDNA</a>.</p>

<p>You can watch those tutorial videos by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrW43fNmjaQVMN1-lsB29ECnHRlA4ebYn">clicking here</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>SolidDNA is framework for creating Solidworks Add-in with C# and WPF programming language.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now there is not much information on how you learn Solidworks C# API over the internet.</p>

<p>Except the official help from Dassault system.</p>

<p>I will be going to cover these in my blog in future so stay tuned till then!!!</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="c-programming-language-1">C++ programming language</h2>

<p>I also learn <strong>C++ programming language</strong> for fun!!!</p>

<p>I want to create the same functionality using the <strong>C++ programming language</strong> and <strong>Solidworks C++ API</strong>.</p>

<p>For learning the <strong>C++ programming language</strong> I read 2 books.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321992784/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thecadcoder-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0321992784&amp;linkId=df27fd45b8dff1b9d3fd9cd9c1754814">Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321958322/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thecadcoder-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0321958322&amp;linkId=67f1afe3b525a5cc0f4e5fcdc606f6f8">The C++ Programming Language</a></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Both of these books are written by <strong><em>Bjarne Stroustrup</em></strong> the creator of the <strong>C++ programming language</strong>.</p>

<p>Out of these 2 two, I would suggest reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321992784/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thecadcoder-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0321992784&amp;linkId=df27fd45b8dff1b9d3fd9cd9c1754814">Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++</a> first.</p>

<p><em>To my surprise, this book is for those who did not have any kind of programming knowledge!!</em></p>

<p>This book teaches how to develop thinking for solving problems programmatically which is very helpful in the long run and not taught by others.</p>

<p><strong>So if you ask me which I book I should buy then I say buy this one book only and you learn to solve problems programmatically!!!</strong></p>

<p>For <strong>Solidworks C++ API</strong>, there is no material available online except <strong>Solidworks default help</strong>.</p>

<p>If you want to know some information about <strong>Solidworks C++ API</strong>, I can help you because I have created a small application using it.</p>

<h2 id="bonus-section">Bonus Section</h2>

<p><em>This section is for you as a reward for reading till here.</em></p>

<p>Here I share with you some tricks and tips whenever I struck with a problem.</p>

<p>So I used the following resources whenever I face any issue:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong><em>Solidworks Offline help</em></strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><em>Google</em></strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><em>Solidworks Forum</em></strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><em>Stackoverflow</em></strong></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="solidworks-offline-help">Solidworks Offline Help</h3>

<p>If I want to do something in <strong>Solidworks API</strong> and I <strong>don’t</strong> know how to do then Solidworks Offline Help is the most useful resource for me to found the solution.</p>

<p>In case you are not able to open offline help then please follow these steps:</p>

<p>a. Select the <strong>Help</strong> option</p>

<p>b. Uncheck the <strong>Use SOLIDWORKS Web help</strong> option as shown in below image.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/Solidworks_Images/other-images/uncheck-solidworks-web-help.png" alt="uncheck-solidworks-web-help" class="img-fluid" /></p>

<p>c. Select <strong>API Help</strong> and open the offline version of <strong>API Help</strong>.</p>

<p>d. go to <strong>Index</strong> tab of <strong>API Help</strong> and type the command you want to search.</p>

<p>for example, if you want to know how to access <em>hole wizard</em> in <strong>Solidworks API</strong>, just type the <em>hole wizard</em> and open 1st option.</p>

<p>This will lead to the <em>hole wizard</em> or something related to it.</p>

<p><em>I personally look for code samples in the help file because they are much helpful to solve the problem and have a pre-written code sample.</em></p>

<h3 id="google">Google</h3>

<p>If I was unable to get any sample code then I use <strong>Google</strong> to look for the solution.</p>

<p>Now I used “<strong><em>How to</em></strong>” approach for searching on <strong>Google</strong>.</p>

<p>For example, I want to <em>open Excel in Solidworks VBA macro</em>.</p>

<p>Thus I will search for “<strong><em>How to open excel in Solidworks VBA</em></strong>”.</p>

<p>This will give us links to the <strong>Solidworks forum</strong> and I will look for a solution of the exact problem or similar problem.</p>

<p>With this approach, I don’t have to create an account in the forum and I can navigate through different answers.</p>

<h3 id="solidworks-forum">Solidworks Forum</h3>

<p>In case, you have <em>an account</em> on the forum and you want to look for the answer 1st there then search for a similar question in forum first.</p>

<p>There would be someone who has a similar problem in past and already asked it. So looks that answer first.</p>

<p><strong>What will you get by doing this exercise?</strong></p>

<p>*If you are lucky then you will get exact code what you are looking for otherwise you will get a similar type of code sample. *</p>

<p>If you are unable to found the answer then ask the question.</p>

<p>There are lots of people who already had macros written and they will share.</p>

<p>Or they will guide you on how to get the answer!!!</p>

<p>But keep in mind that, if you are working on <strong>Add-in</strong> or <strong>standalone</strong> application, you have to wait for it because there are not many people do that and are willing to help in the forum.</p>

<h3 id="stackoverflow">Stackoverflow</h3>

<p>There are some cases where I need to look for <strong>language-specific</strong> answers.</p>

<p>In those cases, I look for answers in <strong><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stackoverflow</a></strong>.</p>

<p>This is a very good website.</p>

<p>Personally, I don’t have any account in <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stackoverflow</a> but still, I managed to get the answers.</p>

<p>I hope this page will help you!!!</p>

<p>If you want to buy any of the recommended books, then please buy them from the links above.</p>
