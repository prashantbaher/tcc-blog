I"Õ	<p>You canâ€™t use VBA very long without being exposed to dialog boxes.</p>

<p>They seem to pop up almost every time you select a command.</p>

<p>VBA uses dialog boxes to obtain information, clarify commands, and display messages.</p>

<p>If you develop VBA macros, you can create your own dialog boxes that work just like those built in.</p>

<p>Those custom dialog boxes are called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UserForms</code> in VBA. About which we look into next section.</p>

<h2 id="userform-alternatives">UserForm Alternatives</h2>

<p>Some of the VBA macros you create behave the same every time you execute them.</p>

<p>For example, you may develop a macro for intermediate steps you do every day.</p>

<p>This macro always produces the same result and requires no additional user input.</p>

<p>You might develop other macros that behave differently under various circumstances or that offer the user options.</p>

<p>In such cases, the macro may benefit from a custom dialog box.</p>

<p>A custom dialog box provides a simple means for getting information from the user.</p>

<p>Your macro then uses that information to determine what it should do.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UserForms</code> can be quite useful, but creating them takes time.</p>

<p>Before I cover the topic of creating UserForms in the next section, you need to know about some potentially timesaving alternatives.</p>

<p>VBA lets you display several different types of dialog boxes that you can sometimes use in place of a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UserForm</code>.</p>

<p>You can customize these built-in dialog boxes in some ways, but they certainly donâ€™t offer the options available in a UserForm.</p>

<p>In some cases, however, theyâ€™re just what you need.</p>

<p>In the following sections you read about</p>
