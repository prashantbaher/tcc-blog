You can support me in following ways:

  2. **Monthly basis**: If you want you can support me on monthly basis.

It is totaly up to you whether you want to support me or not!!!

Also for supporting me you don't need to open any kind of account in it.

I really appreciate your support.

If I got monthly support on regular basis I will consider making some course specially for  monthly supporters or some content specially for them.

Apart from "Buying me a coffee" option, in *Resource* page I have some affiliates links with Amazon products.

Buying from those links also helps me as I will get some commision from Amazon.

I will be transperent with all my visitor.

There are not much product I can promote and I don't want to promote unnecessary product.

Since I have to manage my job and this blog along with my studies for CAD projects.

I will try for more balance between my work and my blog and try to upload post at least 3-4 times a week.

I hope I will achieve this frequency and continue it more longer time.

Again thank you for all those who visit this website and those who support me!!
