## Objective

In this article we **create and understand** VBA macro of **Circular pattern feature** in *SOLIDWORKS CAD Software*.

This method is ***most updated*** method, so ***use this method*** if you want to create a new **Circular pattern Feature** quickly. 

## Results We Can Get

After running our macro we successfully create **Circular pattern feature** as a result.

Below image shows the result we get.

[![circular-pattern-final-result](/assets/Solidworks_Images/feature-circular-pattern/final-result-gif.gif)](/assets/Solidworks_Images/feature-circular-pattern/final-result-gif.gif)

We create **Circular pattern Feature** in following steps in general.

1. *Ask user to select **a Feature**.*
2. *Ask user to select **an edge** in direction 1.*
4. *Ask for **spacing** in direction 1.*
4. *Ask for **spacing** in direction 2.*
5. *Number of **instances** in direction 1.*
6. *Number of **instances** in direction 2.*

> To get the correct result please follow the steps correctly.

## Prerequisite

There are some *prerequisite* for this article.

* Knowledge of **VBA programming language** is ❗***required***.
* We are **not** creating feature from code but we use existing 🚀 **[Extrude feature](/solidworks-macros/create-extrude-feature)** and 🚀 **[Hole feature](solidworks-macros/create-hole-from-hole-wizard/)** to create **Circular pattern feature**.

*Below image shown prerequisite 3D model for our demo.*

[![prerequisite](/assets/Solidworks_Images/feature-circular-pattern/prerequisite.png)](/assets/Solidworks_Images/feature-circular-pattern/prerequisite.png)

As shown in above image, there are ***2 Extrude features*** in our part.

- `Base Feature` : This is our **Base Extrude feature**.
- `Feature To Pattern` : This is our **feature for pattern**.


If you want to create these **Extrude** features ***programmatically*** then please refer to below article.

* 🚀 **[SOLIDWORKS Macros - Create Extrude/Boss](/solidworks-macros/create-extrude-feature)**

We will apply checks in this article, so the code we write should be error free most of the time.

```

* **Purpose**:  In above line, we create a variable for Solidworks Selection Manager.
  *  **Variable Name**: `swSelMgr` 
  * **Type**: `SldWorks.SelectionMgr`.

* **Reference**: Please visit 🚀 **[online SOLIDWORKS API Help](https://help.solidworks.com/2019/english/api/sldworksapi/SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.ISelectionMgr_members.html)**.

```vb
' Variable for Solidworks Entity
Dim swObject As SldWorks.Entity
```

* **Purpose**: In above line, we create a variable for *selection and marking* of Solidworks Entity.
  * **Variable Name**: `swObject`
  * **Type**: `SldWorks.Entity`

* **Reference**: Please visit 🚀 **[online SOLIDWORKS API Help](https://help.solidworks.com/2019/english/api/sldworksapi/SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IEntity_members.html)**.

```vb
' Variable for Solidworks Select Data

```

* **Purpose**: In above line, we create a variable for **Marking** of Solidworks Select Data.
  * **Variable Name**: `swSelData`
  * **Type**: `SldWorks.SelectData`

* **Reference**: Please visit 🚀 **[online SOLIDWORKS API Help](https://help.solidworks.com/2019/english/api/sldworksapi/SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.ISelectData_members.html)**.

```vb
' Variable for Circular pattern feature data
Dim swCircularPatternFeatureData As SldWorks.CircularPatternFeatureData
```

In this line, we create a variable which we named as `swThreadFeatData` and the type of this `swThreadFeatData` variable is `SldWorks.ThreadFeatureData`.

To see methods and properties related to `SldWorks.ThreadFeatureData` object, please visit 🚀 **[this page of SOLIDWORKS API Help]([ILinearPatternFeatureData Interface - 2019 - SOLIDWORKS API Help](https://help.solidworks.com/2019/english/api/sldworksapi/SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.ILinearPatternFeatureData.html))**.

```vb
' Variable for Solidworks Linear pattern Feature
Dim swFeature As SldWorks.Feature
```

In this line, we Create a variable which we named as `swFeature` and the type of this `swFeature` variable is `SldWorks.Feature`.

We create variable `swFeature` for **SOLIDWORKS Linear pattern Feature**.

To see methods and properties related to `Feature` object, please visit 🚀 **[this page of SOLIDWORKS API Help](https://help.solidworks.com/2019/english/api/sldworksapi/SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IFeature_members.html)**.

***These all are our global variables.***

They are **SOLIDWORKS API Objects**.

So basically I group all the **SOLIDWORKS API Objects** in one place.

```vb
' Main program for Linear pattern
Sub main()

End Sub
```

Next is our `Sub` procedure which has name of `main`. 

This procedure hold all the *statements (instructions)* we give to computer.

To know more about **Sub Procedure** you can check 🚀 **[VBA Sub and Function Procedures](/vba/sub-and-function-procedure/)** article of this website.

### Initializing Required Variables

Inside this procedure we first initialize required variables as given below.

* *Set SOLIDWORKS variable to SOLIDWORKS application*

```vb
' Set SOLIDWORKS variable to SOLIDWORKS application
Set swApp = Application.SldWorks
```

In this line, we set the value of our SOLIDWORKS variable `swApp`; which we define earlier; to SOLIDWORKS application.

```vb
' Check if SOLIDWORKS is opened or not
If swApp Is Nothing Then
  MsgBox ("SOLIDWORKS is not opened")
  Exit Sub
End If
```

In above line of code, we use an 🚀 **[IF statement](/vba/if-then-structure-select-case/)** to check if SOLIDWORKS application variable is *successfully assigned* to current SOLIDWORKS application.

* *Set SOLIDWORKS document variable to opened part document*

```vb
' Set SOLIDWORKS document variable to opened part document
Set swDoc = swApp.ActiveDoc
```

In above line of code, we set SOLIDWORKS document `swDoc` variable to currently open part document.

```vb
' Check if SOLIDWORKS document is opened or not
If swDoc Is Nothing Then
  MsgBox ("SOLIDWORKS document is not opened. Please open a document.")
  Exit Sub
End If
```

In above line of code, we use an 🚀 **[IF statement](/vba/if-then-structure-select-case/)** to check if SOLIDWORKS document `swDoc` is opened.

If SOLIDWORKS document is not opened then code execute inside the code and inform the user by a 🚀 **[Message Window](/vba/msgBox-function/)**.

* *Set SOLIDWORKS Selection Manager variable*

```vb
' Set SOLIDWORKS Selection Manager variable
Set swSelMgr = swDoc.SelectionManager
```

In above line, we set SOLIDWORKS Selection Manager`swSelMgr` variable to current document's Selection Manager.

* Array of SOLIDWORKS Entities

```vb
' Array of Solidworks Entities
Dim swObjects(1 To 3) As SldWorks.Entity
```

In this line, we create an Array of SOLIDWORKS Entities which we named as `swObjects` and the type of this `SldWorks.Entity` variable is `SldWorks.Entity`.

This array consist *two* `SldWorks.Entity` variables.

We define the number of variable this array holds inside **(1 To 3)**.

For more information about the **Arrays** in VBA please 🚀 **[Array on this website](/vba/arrays/)**.

* *Local variable for User selection*

```vb
' Local variable for selection
Dim selectItems As Integer
selectItems = 1
```

In above line of code, we define a Local variable name `selectItems`as **Integer** type.

In next line we assign a value of **1**.

### Ask user to select feature and directions

Now we will ask user to select **feature and directions** for *Linear Pattern feature*.

Please follow steps given below.

```vb
' Loop till we select all entities
While selectItems <= 3

Wend
```

In above line of code we start a `While` loop.

For more details about `While` loop, please see 🚀 **[VBA Looping](/vba/looping/)** article from this website.

We want to loop until `selectItems` variable's value is equal to **3**.

```vb
' Message to show user
Dim messageToUser As String
```

In above line of code we create a variable named `messageToUser` of `String` type.

This variable holds the message we want to show before selection.

```vb
' Update Messages
Select Case selectItems
  Case 1
    messageToUser = "Please select a Feature for Linear Pattern."
  Case 2
    messageToUser = "Please select first Edge for Direction 1."
  Case 3
    messageToUser = "Please select second Edge for Direction 2."
  Case Else
    Exit Sub
End Select
```

In above line of code, we use a `Select` statement to update message.

We use the `case` on `selectItems`.

When `selectItems = 1` then value of `messageToUser` update to `"Please select a Feature for Linear Pattern."`

When `selectItems = 2` then value of `messageToUser` update to `"Please select first Edge for Direction 1."`

Similarly, when `selectItems = 3` then value of `messageToUser` update to `"Please select second Edge for Direction 2."`

```vb
' Show message to user
MsgBox messageToUser
```

In above line of code, we show the message to user.

Below image shows the message for **Feature selection** to the user.

[![message-to-select-feature-for-linear-pattern](/assets/Solidworks_Images/feature-linear-pattern/message-to-select-feature-for-linear-pattern.png)](/assets/Solidworks_Images/feature-linear-pattern/message-to-select-feature-for-linear-pattern.png)

Below image shows the message for **first Edge for Direction 1** to the user.

[![message-to-select-edge-for-direction-1](/assets/Solidworks_Images/feature-linear-pattern/message-to-select-edge-for-direction-1.png)](/assets/Solidworks_Images/feature-linear-pattern/message-to-select-edge-for-direction-1.png)

Below image shows the message for **second Edge for Direction 2** to the user.

[![message-to-select-edge-for-direction-2](/assets/Solidworks_Images/feature-linear-pattern/message-to-select-edge-for-direction-2.png)](/assets/Solidworks_Images/feature-linear-pattern/message-to-select-edge-for-direction-2.png)

```vb
' Loop until we complete our selection
While swObjects(selectItems) Is Nothing
    
Wend
```

In above line of code, we create another `While` loop.

This loops until we select the our **Profile** and **Path**.

For more details about `While` loop, please see 🚀 **[VBA Looping](/vba/looping/)** article from this website.

```vb
' Local integer for loop
Dim i As Integer
```

In above line of code, we create a local integer name `i` as a counter.

```vb
' Loop until we select
For i = 1 To swSelMgr.GetSelectedObjectCount2(-1)

Next
```

In above line of code, we create a `For` loop.

This code loops from `i = 1` to number of `objects` we select.

```vb
' Update Messages
Select Case selectItems

End Select
```

In above line of code, we use a `Select` statement for selection entities.

We use the `case` on `selectItems`.

```vb
Case 1
	' If the profile sketch is selected
  If swSelMgr.GetSelectedObjectType3(i, -1) = swSelectType_e.swSelBODYFEATURES Then

    ' Set the Solidworks Entity object to feature for Linear pattern
    Set swObjects(selectItems) = swSelMgr.GetSelectedObject6(i, -1)

    ' If the face is selected
  ElseIf swSelMgr.GetSelectedObjectType3(i, -1) = swSelectType_e.swSelFACES Then

    ' Inform user to select feature from Feature Tree
    MsgBox "Please select Feature from Feature Tree."

    ' Clear selection
    swDoc.ClearSelection2 True
  End If
```

Above code sample we use for **`Case 1`**.

In above line of code, we use  🚀 **[IF/Else statement](/vba/if-then-structure-select-case/)**  with conditions.

The  🚀 **[IF statement](/vba/if-then-structure-select-case/)**  is `True` when selected `object` is type of *SOLIDWORKS Body Feature*.

Similarly,  🚀 **[Else statement](/vba/if-then-structure-select-case/)**  is True when select `object` is type of *SOLIDWORKS Face*.

When we select the sketch from Model view, then selected object is *SOLIDWORKS Face*.
<br>
When we select the sketch from Feature Tree, then select object is *SOLIDWORKS Body Feature*.
{: .notice}

When  🚀 **[IF statement](/vba/if-then-structure-select-case/)** is True we execute code given below.

```vb
' Set the Solidworks Entity object to feature for Linear pattern
Set swObjects(selectItems) = swSelMgr.GetSelectedObject6(i, -1)
```

In above line, we set the indexed object inside array.

* *Array of SOLIDWORKS Entities* = `swObjects`
* *Indexed Entity Object* = `swObjects[selectItems]`

We set the value of this **Indexed Entity Object** by `GetSelectedObject6()` method of SOLIDWORKS Selection Manager.

When we set the **Indexed Entity Object** value as **feature to mirror**, we exit the 2nd `While` loop.

Similarly, when  🚀 **[Else statement](/vba/if-then-structure-select-case/)** is True we execute code given below.

```vb
' Inform user to select feature from Feature Tree
MsgBox "Please select feature from Feature Tree."

' Clear selection
swDoc.ClearSelection2 True
```

1. We show message to user to select **Feature** from *Feature Tree*.
2. After that we clear our selection.

> We do this because if selected object type is *SOLIDWORKS Face* then we can not assign this object as SOLIDWORKS Entity inside array.

```vb
Case 2, 3
  ' If the edge is selected
  If swSelMgr.GetSelectedObjectType3(i, -1) = swSelectType_e.swSelEDGES Then
  
    ' Set the Solidworks Entity object to selected edge
    Set swObjects(selectItems) = swSelMgr.GetSelectedObject6(i, -1)

  Else
    ' Inform user to select edge
    MsgBox "Please select a Edge."

    ' Clear selection
    swDoc.ClearSelection2 True
  End If
```

Above code sample we use for **`Case 2`** and **`Case 3`**.

In above line of code, we use  🚀 **[IF/Else statement](/vba/if-then-structure-select-case/)**  with conditions.

The  🚀 **[IF statement](/vba/if-then-structure-select-case/)**  is `True` when selected `object` is type of *SOLIDWORKS Edge*.

If we the selected `object` is **not** type of *SOLIDWORKS Edge* then 🚀 **[Else statement](/vba/if-then-structure-select-case/)** code runs.

When  🚀 **[IF statement](/vba/if-then-structure-select-case/)** is True we execute code given below.

```vb
' Set the Solidworks Entity object to selected Edge
Set swObjects(selectItems) = swSelMgr.GetSelectedObject6(i, -1)
```

In above line, we set the indexed object inside array.

* *Array of SOLIDWORKS Entities* = `swObjects`
* *Indexed Entity Object* = `swObjects[selectItems]`

We set the value of this **Indexed Entity Object** by `GetSelectedObject6()` method of SOLIDWORKS Selection Manager.

When we set the **Indexed Entity Object** value as **feature to mirror**, we exit the 2nd `While` loop.

Similarly, when  🚀 **[Else statement](/vba/if-then-structure-select-case/)** is True we execute code given below.

```vb
' Inform user to select edge
MsgBox "Please select a Edge."

' Clear selection
swDoc.ClearSelection2 True
```

1. We show message to user to select **Edge**. 
2. After that we clear our selection.

After `For` loop, we have a call for **`DoEvents`** function.

This function repeats the `While` loop until we select the **Feature or Edge**.

```vb
' Clear previous selection
swDoc.ClearSelection2 True

' Increase the selection count
selectItems = selectItems + 1
```

In above line, when we finished with the **Profile or Path** selection, we clear previous selection and increment the selected count by 1.

After increment the selected count we continue our `while` loop.

### Mark selected Entities

Till now we have completed our selection.

Now we need to do **Select and Mark entities** correctly from our Array.

```vb
' Local variable for counter
Dim j As Integer
j = 1
```

In above line of code we create `integer` variable for counter.

```vb
' Loop till counter is 3, since we have 3 selection
While j < 4

Wend
```

In above line of code we create a `while` loop with condition that *counter value* of **`j`** should be *less than 4.*

```vb
' Set the current instance to Solidworks Entity variable
Set swObject = swObjects(j)
```

In above line of code, we set the SOLIDWORKS Entity variable to current object from array.

```vb
' Create Select data for this entity
Set swSelData = swSelMgr.CreateSelectData
```

In above line of code, we create SOLIDWORKS Select Data for current SOLIDWORKS Entity object.

```vb
' Update Messages
Select Case j

End Select
```

In above line of code, we use a `Select` statement for selection entities.

We use the `case` on `j`.

```vb
Case 1
  ' For feature to pattern, set mark to 4
  swSelData.Mark = 4
```

Above code sample we use for **`Case 1`**.

In above lines, we update the **Mark** to **`4`** for our *SOLIDWORKS Select Data* variable.

For ***Linear Pattern*** feature, **`Mark`** values can be follows:

| Any...             | Must be preselected and marked with a value of... |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Direction 1        | 1                                                 |
| Direction 2        | 2                                                 |
| Feature to pattern | 4                                                 |

For more details about **Mark** please visit 🚀 **[Linear Pattern Feature](https://help.solidworks.com/2019/english/api/sldworksapi/SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.ILinearPatternFeatureData.html)** in *SOLIDWORS API Help*.

```vb
Case 2
  ' For direction 1, set mark to 1
  swSelData.Mark = 1
```

Above code sample we use for **`Case 2`**.

In above lines, we update the **Mark** to **`1`** for our *SOLIDWORKS Select Data* variable.

For ***Linear Pattern*** feature, **`Mark`** values can be follows:

| Any...             | Must be preselected and marked with a value of... |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Direction 1        | 1                                                 |
| Direction 2        | 2                                                 |
| Feature to pattern | 4                                                 |

For more details about **Mark** please visit 🚀 **[Linear Pattern Feature](https://help.solidworks.com/2019/english/api/sldworksapi/SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.ILinearPatternFeatureData.html)** in *SOLIDWORS API Help*.

```vb
Case 3
  ' For plane, set mark to 2
  swSelData.Mark = 2	
```

Above code sample we use for **`Case 3`**.

In above lines, we update the **Mark** to **`3`** for our *SOLIDWORKS Select Data* variable.

For ***Linear Pattern*** feature, **`Mark`** values can be follows:

| Any...             | Must be preselected and marked with a value of... |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Direction 1        | 1                                                 |
| Direction 2        | 2                                                 |
| Feature to pattern | 4                                                 |

For more details about **Mark** please visit 🚀 **[Linear Pattern Feature](https://help.solidworks.com/2019/english/api/sldworksapi/SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.ILinearPatternFeatureData.html)** in *SOLIDWORS API Help*.

```vb
' Select the current entity
swObject.Select4 True, swSelData
```

In above line of code, we select the Feature object.

We select it by using `Select4` method of *SOLIDWORKS Entity object*.

This method takes 2 arguments.

1. **Append** - *`True` appends the entity to the selection list, `False` replaces the selection list with this entity.*
2. **Data** - *Pointer to the **`ISelectData`** object.*

We use following values as parameter.

1. **Append** - **`True`**
2. **Data** - **`swSelData`**

```vb
j = j + 1
```

After **`Select`** statement, we increment the counter variable **`j`** by **1**.

### Get unit Conversion factors

Now we need to get unit Conversion factors as shown in below code.

```vb
'-----------------------Unit Conversion Factors----------------------------------------
  
' Local variables used as Conversion Factors
Dim LengthConversionFactor As Double
Dim AngleConversionFactor As Double

' Use a Select Case, to get the length of active Unit and set the different factors
Select Case swDoc.GetUnits(0)       ' GetUnits function gives us, active unit

Case swMETER    ' If length is in Meter
  LengthConversionFactor = 1
  AngleConversionFactor = 1

Case swMM       ' If length is in MM
  LengthConversionFactor = 1 / 1000
  AngleConversionFactor = 1 * 0.01745329

Case swCM       ' If length is in CM
  LengthConversionFactor = 1 / 100
  AngleConversionFactor = 1 * 0.01745329

Case swINCHES   ' If length is in INCHES
  LengthConversionFactor = 1 * 0.0254
  AngleConversionFactor = 1 * 0.01745329

Case swFEET     ' If length is in FEET
  LengthConversionFactor = 1 * (0.0254 * 12)
  AngleConversionFactor = 1 * 0.01745329

Case swFEETINCHES     ' If length is in FEET & INCHES
  LengthConversionFactor = 1 * 0.0254  ' For length we use sama as Inch
  AngleConversionFactor = 1 * 0.01745329

Case swANGSTROM        ' If length is in ANGSTROM
  LengthConversionFactor = 1 / 10000000000#
  AngleConversionFactor = 1 * 0.01745329

Case swNANOMETER       ' If length is in NANOMETER
  LengthConversionFactor = 1 / 1000000000
  AngleConversionFactor = 1 * 0.01745329

Case swMICRON       ' If length is in MICRON
  LengthConversionFactor = 1 / 1000000
  AngleConversionFactor = 1 * 0.01745329
End Select

'----------------------------------------------------------------
```

### Create Linear Pattern Feature Definition 

We have completed our *selection* of 🚀 **[SOLIDWORKS Entity](https://help.solidworks.com/2019/english/api/sldworksapi/SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IEntity_members.html)**.

Now we create  🚀 [Linear Pattern feature Definition](https://help.solidworks.com/2019/english/api/sldworksapi/SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.ILinearPatternFeatureData.html) and set its properties for **Linear Pattern**.

```vb
'Create linear pattern feature data
Set swLinearPatternFeatureData = swDoc.FeatureManager.CreateDefinition(swFmLPattern)
```

In above line of code we set the value of variable `swLinearPatternFeatureData` by `CreateDefinition` method.

`CreateDefinition` method is part of `FeatureManager` object.

This `FeatureManager` is again part of `swDoc` variable i.e. `ModelDoc2` object.

This `CreateDefinition` method takes following parameters as explained:

  - **Type** - *`Feature name ID` as defined in `swFeatureNameID_e`*.

    - `swFmBoundingBox` *(bounding box)*
    - `swFmCirPattern` *(circular pattern)*
    - `swFmCurvePattern` *(curve-driven pattern)*

    - `swFmLocalChainPattern` *(chain component pattern)*
    - `swFmLocalCirPattern` *(circular component pattern)*
    - `swFmLocalCurvePattern` *(curve-driven component pattern)*
    - `swFmLocalLPattern` *(linear component pattern)*
    - `swFmLocalSketchPattern` *(sketch-driven component pattern)*
    - `swFmLPattern` *(linear pattern)*
    - `swFmNormalCut` *(sheet metal normal cut)*
    - `swFmRefCurve` *(projection curve)*
    - `swFmRefSurface` *(surface sweep)*
    - `swFmSketchPattern` *(sketch-driven pattern)*
    - `swFmSweep` *(boss sweep)*
    - `swFmSweepCut` *(cut sweep)*
    - `swFmSweepThread` *(Thread)*
    - `swFmTabAndSlot` *(tab and slot)*
    - `swFmTablePattern` *(table pattern)*

**Return Value** : This `CreateDefinition` method return **feature or pattern-specific** feature data object.

In our code, I have used following values:

  - **Type** - *I use `swFmLPattern` as `Feature name ID`*.

If you want to know more information about **Linear Pattern Feature data** then please visit 🚀 **[this page of Solidworks API Help](https://help.solidworks.com/2019/english/api/sldworksapi/SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.ILinearPatternFeatureData_members.html)**.

This page will give you information about various properties and methods of `ILinearPatternFeatureData` Interface.

```vb
' Set Linear pattern feature data values
swLinearPatternFeatureData.D1EndCondition = swPatternEndCondition_e.swPatternEndCondition_SpacingAndInstances
swLinearPatternFeatureData.D1ReverseDirection = False
swLinearPatternFeatureData.D1Spacing = InputBox("Please select spacing in direction 1") * LengthConversionFactor
swLinearPatternFeatureData.D1TotalInstances = InputBox("Number of instances in direction 1")
swLinearPatternFeatureData.D2EndCondition = swPatternEndCondition_e.swPatternEndCondition_SpacingAndInstances
swLinearPatternFeatureData.D2PatternSeedOnly = False
swLinearPatternFeatureData.D2ReverseDirection = False
swLinearPatternFeatureData.D2Spacing = InputBox("Please select spacing in direction 2") * LengthConversionFactor
swLinearPatternFeatureData.D2TotalInstances = InputBox("Number of instances in direction 2")
swLinearPatternFeatureData.GeometryPattern = False
swLinearPatternFeatureData.VarySketch = False
```

In above lines, we set various properties of Linear Pattern feature definition.

```vb
swLinearPatternFeatureData.D1EndCondition = swPatternEndCondition_e.swPatternEndCondition_SpacingAndInstances
```

In above line of code we set how to specify the spacing of pattern instances for **Direction 1** as defined in below table.

| Member                                          | Description                                                  |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **`swPatternEndCondition_SpacingAndInstances`** | **`0`** = Independently set the pattern instance number and spacing |
| **`swPatternEndCondition_UpToReference`**       | **`1`** = Pattern instance number and spacing is based on a selected up-to-reference geometry and an offset |

```vb
swLinearPatternFeatureData.D1ReverseDirection = False
```

In above line code code, we set value of `D1ReverseDirection` to `False`.

This means we did not want to reverse direction 1.

```vb
swLinearPatternFeatureData.D1Spacing = InputBox("Please select spacing in direction 1") * LengthConversionFactor
```

In above line of code we are doing **3 steps** in one line.

Those 3 steps are explained below.

* **Step 1** - Getting direction 1 spacing from user.

Below image shows the message for **direction 1 spacing** to the user.

[![message-to-select-spacing-for-direction-1](/assets/Solidworks_Images/feature-linear-pattern/message-to-select-spacing-for-direction-1.png)](/assets/Solidworks_Images/feature-linear-pattern/message-to-select-spacing-for-direction-1.png)

* **Step 2** - Convert input spacing as per document unit system.
* **Step 3** - Assigned converted value to **`swLinearPatternFeatureData.D1Spacing`** property.

**`swLinearPatternFeatureData.D1Spacing`** property gets or sets the spacing between pattern instances in Direction 1 of this linear pattern feature.

### Create Linear Pattern

```vb
' Create Linear pattern
Set swFeature = swDoc.FeatureManager.CreateFeature(swLinearPatternFeatureData)
```

In above line of code we set the value of variable `swFeature` by `CreateFeature` method.

This `CreateFeature` method takes following parameters as explained:

  - **FeatureData** - *`Feature or pattern-specific` feature data object*.

**Return Value** : This `CreateFeature` method return **feature** data object.

`CreateFeature` method is part of `FeatureManager` object.

This `FeatureManager` is again part of `swDoc` variable i.e. `ModelDoc2` object.

To see methods and properties related to `FeatureManager` object, please visit 🚀 **[this page of SOLIDWORKS API Help](https://help.solidworks.com/2019/english/api/sldworksapi/SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IFeatureManager_members.html)**.

In our code, I have used following values:

  - **FeatureData** - *I use `swLinearPatternFeatureData` as feature data object which we defined previously*.

```vb
' Check if Linear Pattern creates or not
If swFeature Is Nothing Then
  MsgBox ("Failed to create Linear Pattern.")
  Exit Sub
End If
```

In above line of code, we use an 🚀 **[IF statement](/vba/if-then-structure-select-case/)** to check if we able to create 🚀 **[Linear Pattern Feature](https://help.solidworks.com/2019/english/api/sldworksapi/SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.ILinearPatternFeatureData_members.html)** or not.

If we failed to select then inform the user by a 🚀 **[Message Window](/vba/msgBox-function/)**.

After showing error message our program **exit** from here itself.

Now we run the macro and after running macro we get Revolve as shown in below image.

[![linear-pattern-final-result](/assets/Solidworks_Images/feature-linear-pattern/linear-pattern-final-result.png)](/assets/Solidworks_Images/feature-linear-pattern/linear-pattern-final-result.png)

### Final work

After creating **Linear Pattern** feature, we have to do some cleaning work so that we can use this macro frequently.

* Empty SOLIDWORKS Entity Array

```vb
' Erase array data
Erase swObjects
```

In above line, we **erase** data from *SOLIDWORKS Entity array*.

For this we use **`Erase`** function in-build in VBA.

* Make part Zoom to fit

```vb
' View zoom to fit
swDoc.ViewZoomtofit2
```

In above line, we make our view zoom to fit the model.

For this we use `ViewZoomtofit2` method which is part of *SOLIDWORKS Document* variable i.e `swDoc` variable.

* Clear selection

```vb
' Clear all selection
swDoc.ClearSelection2 True
```

In above line, we clear all previous selection.

For this we use `ClearSelection2` method which is part of *SOLIDWORKS Document* variable i.e `swDoc` variable.
